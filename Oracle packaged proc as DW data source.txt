This undocumented PowerBuilder feature may be useful only for developers working with Oracle databases.

When you select "Stored Procedure" as the data source for your DataWindow, a dropdown lists all available stored procedures in the database.
Unfortunately, this list includes only standalone procedures — it doesn't show those defined inside packages.
To use a packaged stored procedure, you'll have to trick PowerBuilder a little.

Let's say you want to use my_package.my_proc. Here's what you need to do.

Step 1: Create a temporary standalone procedure with the same name and arguments as the real packaged procedure, but with no logic — just use NULL; as the body.

Step 2: In the DataWindow Painter, select this temporary standalone procedure from the dropdown as the data source (you may need to reconnect to the database if it doesn't appear).

Step 3: Save and close the DataWindow.

Step 4: Right-click the DataWindow and select "Edit Source".

Step 5: Find the occurrence of my_proc and add my_package. in front of it (with the dot), so it becomes my_package.my_proc.

Step 6: Save the DataWindow. You've just done the impossible!

Step 7: Delete the temporary standalone procedure.

You can use the same trick for the procedures used for insert, update, and delete operations (DataWindow Painter > menu "Rows" > "Stored Procedure Update").
